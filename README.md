# Tim Kim's MagicaVoxel Shaders
Greetings and welcome to my collection of shaders that I've written to be used with the very excellent MagicaVoxel. 

# How to install
You can choose to install a lot of ways but essentially grab whichever `shader/*.txt` file and place it in your
own MagicaVoxel's folder structure under the `MagicaVoxel-x.xx.x-xxx/shader/` folder.

# Writing your own shaders
@lachlanmcdonald's [guide](https://github.com/lachlanmcdonald/magicavoxel-shaders/wiki/Notes) was a huge help for me
in understanding how MagicaVoxel's shaders work internally. I'd highly recommend you start there. 

As well as the resource [thebookofshaders.com](thebookofshaders.com).
